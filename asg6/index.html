	<h1>Six Thinking Hats Assignment- 6</h1>

	<h2>Halle Northridge</h2>

	<h3>White Hat</h3>
	<p>Snackbrief is a website for students, designers and artists that gives the user daily design prompts to inspire and spark creativity. It offers daily prompts, archives of old submissions, and community interaction. 
		The information we need for the project is what format the prompts should be in, and how they will be worded and organized. Also, how will the submissions be displayed in the archives? 
		I am missing a clear, detailed plan for my users' interaction. For example, I mention an archive of popular submissions, but no voting or deciding system. Additionally, I state that I want to have “new, fresh” 
		prompts daily, but not HOW.</p>
	
	<h3>Red Hat</h3>
	<p>This project seems fun, approachable and motivating. The idea is simple yet effective. People might use this site as a warm-up or creative break. It has a friendly, low-pressure vibe, which is great for engagement. 
		My feeling on it is that it offers opportunity for community connection, but I am a bit concerned about maintaining fresh content daily long term.</p>
	
	<h3>Black Hat</h3>
	<p>Although I want it to be minimal, if the site is TOO minimal, it may become boring or uninspiring. By having new prompts daily, I also risk having boring, repetitive or low quality prompts. 
		It may be hard to grow without social media features and connections. I also risk user retention. People may visit it once, and completely forget about it. In other words, it might be seen as just another 
		“prompt site” unless it has a unique tone or brand identity.</p>
	
	<h3>Yellow Hat</h3>
	<p>The idea is simple, accessible, and fun. It promotes creativity without feeling like a heavy or big project or “work”. I want it to feel more like a fun little challenge almost like a free, 
		fun doodle versus a big, serious project. It aims to help users improve creative thinking and consistency. My idea to make this work better or hold retention or engagement is to have a streak tracker 
		or some other aspects to make it more “game” or “challenge”-like to encourage daily participation.</p>
	
	<h3>Green Hat</h3>
	<p>Instead of just design prompts, I could mix in some photography or maybe writing prompts, or perhaps different “versions” of the same daily prompts for different types of art (photography, writing etc). 
		I could add engagement features such as voting and sharing directly through the site.</p>
	
	<h3>Blue Hat</h3>
	<p>The subject of my site is to generate design prompts daily. I am thinking about how to make the site more useful, engaging and sustainable long term. My goal is to create a simple, inspiring tool for designers 
		seeking creative refreshers and inspiration.</p>
